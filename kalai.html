</h4>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animal
    With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move
    and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form a clade, meaning that they arose from a single
    common ancestor.Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described, of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, 
    and <u>around 65,000 </u>are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77 million animal species on Earth. Animal body
    lengths range from 8.5 Î¼m (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their 
    environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviors is
     known as ethology.</h4><p>

    reference to any member of a larger bird group, order Psittaciformes, which includes cockatoos (family Cacatuidae) as well. Parrots have
    been kept as cage birds since ancient times, and they have always been popular because 
    they are amusing, intelligent, and often affectionate. Several are astonishingly imitative of many sounds, including human speech.</h4>

    <h4>The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog's companionship can enhance human physical and psychological well-being.
    [222] Studies suggest that there are benefits to physical health and psychological well-being, but they have been criticized for being 
            
            
    "poorly controlled".[223][224] One study states that "the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their 
    ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal".[225] Earlier studies have shown that pet-dog or -cat guardians make fewer hospital visits and
     are less likely to be on medication for heart problems and sleeping difficulties than<sup>non-guardians.</sup>non-guardians.[225] People with pet dogs took considerably more
    physical exercise than those with cats or those without pets; these effects are relatively long-term.[226] Pet guardianship has also been associated with 
    increased survival in cases of coronary artery disease. Human guardians are significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial 
    infarction than those who do not own dogs.
    <sub>[227] </sub>Studies have found a small to moderate correlation between dog-ownership and increased adult physical-activity levels.[228]</h4>

     <h4>The African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) is the largest elephant species and the biggest terrestrial animal on Earth.
     According to WWF, these elephants roam across sub-Saharan Africa in family units composed of around 10 females and their young. 
    Often, these <mark> units join to form "clans" of several hundred elephants that are headed by a single female matriarch</mark>.
    This leadership role is usually assigned to the oldest and most experienced female of the group.</h4>
